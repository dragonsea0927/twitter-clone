### Installation 🛠️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devdignesh/twitter-clone.git
cd twitter-clone
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Before running the development server, make sure to create `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the required environment variables. You can use the example provided in the repository as a starting point.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Prisma

This project leverages the power of Prisma ORM for seamless database interaction. Prisma provides a modern database toolkit that simplifies database access, allowing for efficient querying, migrations, and schema management.

Run the following command to generate the Prisma client:

```bash
cp npx prisma generate
```

This command generates TypeScript typings for Prisma Client based on your database schema.

After generating the Prisma client, ensure that any changes made to the database schema are synchronized with the actual database. Run the following command:

```bash
cp npx prisma db push
```

This command applies any pending migrations to the database, ensuring that the local database reflects the latest schema changes made in the codebase.
